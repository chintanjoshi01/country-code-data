# Country Code Data Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of country codes in JSON and CSV formats, accompanied by mobile number length information for each country. The dataset is designed to assist developers, businesses, and researchers in implementing and validating phone number functionalities within applications.

## Files

- **`country_codes_data.json`**: JSON file with country codes, names, mobile codes, and mobile number length.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
   "name": "India",
   "dial_code": "91",
   "code": "IN",
   "mobile_number_length": 10
  }
   //more countries
  ```
- **`country_codes_data.csv`**: CSV file with columns for country code, country name, mobile code, and mobile number length.

  Example:
  | Name      | Dial Code | Code | Mobile Number Length |
  |-----------|-----------|------|-----------------------|
  | India     | 91        | IN   | 10                    |


## How to Use

Developers can integrate this data into their applications for phone number validation and formatting. The dataset is regularly updated to ensure accuracy.
Usage Example

```java
    private ArrayList<CodeModel> getCountryCodeList() {
    // Assuming `getJsonFromAssets` and `R.string.country_codes_data_json` are methods and resources defined elsewhere in your code
    String dataCode = getJsonFromAssets(this, getString(R.string.country_codes_data_json));
    Gson gson = new Gson();
    Type listCode = new TypeToken<ArrayList<CodeModel>>() {}.getType();
    
    return gson.fromJson(dataCode, listCode);
    }
```
